# What's the big deal?

I use my free time to create cool things and release them - for free - through my website, [www.aaronpowell.me](http://www.aaronpowell.me). These open projects come complete with the source files you need to remake them all on your own, including 3D files, image textures, videos, code, text documents, and more!

If you like what I do and want to see more, [consider becoming a Patreon supporter](https://www.patreon.com/aaronpowell). To give back to the community, 10% of your monthly support is donated to the amazing open-source initiatives that help make these projects happen.
